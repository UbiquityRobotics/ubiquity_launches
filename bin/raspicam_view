##Summary: Start the Raspberry Pi camera and show its output on the screen.
##Overview:
##  This program will start the Raspberry Pi camera on the robot and
##  show the resulting images on the laptop/desktop machine.  This program
##  uses `rqt_image_view` view the image.  Due to race conditions, the
##  the `rqt_image_view` program may come up before all image topics
##  are present.  When this happens please click on the refresh button
##  (a green clockwise arrow) to update the available image topics.
##  Please select the topic entitled `/n_raspicam/image/camera/compressed`
##  to view a reasonably real-time image coming out of the Raspberry Pi
##  camera.

# Use `rosrun` to find `roslauncher` which does all the heavy lifting:
rosrun ubiquity_launches roslauncher m_raspicam_view.launch.xml
