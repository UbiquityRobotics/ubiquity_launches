# This program sweeps through the `ubiquity_launches` directory
# and scans executables in the `bin` sub-directory and any launch
# file anywhere under `ubiquity_launches`.
#
# Two operations are performed:
#
# * It scrapes executables and launch files to write documentation
#   into the `launches.md` file.
#
# * Using the binary executables, it recursively visits all used
#   launch files.  If a launch file is not used, it is flagged as
#   unused and it should be deleted from the repository.
